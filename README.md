# RTUnVehicle
Do you want all the features of RogueTech without having every enemy lance comprised entirely of ridiculously overpowered vehicles? Well boy howdy, do I have a script for you!

This script will modify the Lance files in roguetech to remove vehicles from nearly every Lance type, except lances that are only comprised of vehicles, and specialty lances made for missions where it is intended you fight vehicles.

# Usage
1) Download Ruby from https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/
2) `gem install json`
3) Download this ruby script, `RTUnvehicle.rb` and place it in its own directory
4) Go to your BattleTech installation folder, and copy `\Mods\RogueTech Core\Lances` into the same directory as `RTUnvehicle.rb`
5) Open a cmd prompt, navigate to the directory you placed the `Lances` folder and `rtUnvehicle.rb`, and type `ruby RTUnvehicle.rb` to run the script
6) Follow the instructions provided to copy the new Lance files into the RT directory.
7) Enjoy the game about mechs not having 90% of the spawns be vehicles!

#Future Plans
I might modify the script in the future depending on how well it does removing vehicles. I may expand it to modify other aspects related to vehicles depending on how I like the results. It will never modify anything beyond things related to vehicle spawns though.

DO NOT bring any problems to the RogueTech team, they will NOT help you out. There is no support, official or otherwise. You use this script and modify the files at your own risk.

#Thank Yous
You Know Who, thank you for the inspiration to create this after being extremely rude and dismissive about this for the past few years, and denying its possible because its too much work. Took 30 minutes. I play how and what I want, thank you.
